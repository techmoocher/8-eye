# Contributing (Nerd Mode)

Thanks for hacking on the prompt stack. A few house rules to keep the silicon spirits happy:

## Ground rules

- Stay in ASCII unless the task demands fancy glyphs.
- Keep roles, guardrails, and workflows explicit; no silent edits.
- Cite sources/criteria if you introduce scoring rubrics or reference material.
- No full-answer shortcuts in “evaluation” prompts—learning over spoon-feeding.

## Workflow

- Branch from main; small, reviewable changes win.
- Run a quick “Hello World” chat to sanity-check new/changed prompts.
- Include sample conversations for major changes (acts as unit tests).
- Update relevant docs: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/README.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/README.md) or other index files if paths/structures change.

## Style guide

- Bullets > prose walls; keep instructions testable and scoped.
- Name files and links with workspace-relative paths so they resolve anywhere.
- Call out forbidden behaviors explicitly in guardrails.
- Prefer concise, constructive tone; keep a pinch of wit.

## PR checklist

- Linked docs and paths render correctly.
- Guardrails intact; no unrequested full-answer behavior added.
- Sample convo(s) included for big changes.
- Commit messages say what changed and why.
